# Aquarium Simulator 🐠

### ⚙️ Tools
REST API application built with Java Spring Boot.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This application is not designed for use in a real distributed environment. 
It's intended as a test project to experiment with ApplicationRunner and timers for frequently updating aquarium stats in the database. 
Due to the high frequency of updates, handling large datasets could lead to performance issues.

### 👾 Description
Create and manage your own aquariums! Populate them with fishes from different species, feed them, clean their tanks, and watch them grow. 
But be careful: if you neglect them, your fishes might not survive! 🙏🏻🐟
